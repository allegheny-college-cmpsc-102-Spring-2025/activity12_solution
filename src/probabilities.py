# This example defines a six-sided die using FiniteSet and calculates the probability of getting an even number or a number greater than 4. The calculate_probability function is used to compute the probability of an event based on the number of favorable outcomes and the total number of possible outcomes. The Rational class from sympy is used to represent exact fractions to maintain precision in the probability calculations.

# Note: you will have to create a virtual environment to run this code.
# The commands are the following
# python3 -m venv ~/Desktop/myVenv # Unix
# python -m venv c:\YOUR_PATH\myVenv # Windows

# Run source to start the virtual environment
# source ~/Desktop/myVenv/bin/activate # Unix
# c:\YOUR_PATH\myVenv\scripts\activate # Windows
#
# Install Sympy library with pip once the virtual environment has started
# pip install sympy
# Now, run your code
